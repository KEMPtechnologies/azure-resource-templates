# KEMP LoadMaster Multinic

Since 2000, KEMP has been a consistent leader in innovation with a number of industry firsts, including high performance ADC appliance virtualization, application-centric SDN and NFV integration, innovative pricing and licensing models and true platform ubiquity that can scale to support enterprises of every size and workload requirement.

**Note: This template requires an existing Subnet and VNET prior to deployment.**

This template deploys a KEMP LoadMaster with multiple NICs. Doing so will enabled the Virtual LoadMaster to have more than one interface and expose additional fucntionality such as:

* Greater performance enhanced by additive bandwith 
* Enabling extended topologies 
* Multiple networks without the need for VLAN trunking
* Management isolation to a specific NIC
